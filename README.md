# YouTube-Bot
YouTube bot, this is just my introduction to api and requests, this isn't intended on being an actual view bot.

Credits:
Made by ! Aran#9999, report any bugs or issues you face there or in the discord server ~ https://discord.gg/QjUUwpnpku

Usage:
All you have to do is run the batch file attached to the bot to download the libraries if needed.

If that doesn't work you can try in cmd/shell/terminal, pip install requests and pip install colorama

If the above doesn't work try python -m pip install requests and -m pip install colorama

Finally if none of the above work try python3 -m pip install requests and python3 -m pip install colorama
